    <h1>FilmFinder</h1>
    <p>
      FilmFinder is a students built movie database. Every
      piece of data has been added by our amazing students dating back to
      2023. Our strong international focus and breadth of data is largely
      unmatched and something we're incredibly proud of. Put simply, we live
      and breathe community and that's precisely what makes us different.
