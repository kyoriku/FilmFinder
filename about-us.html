        <h1>U of T Movies Database</h1>

        <p>
          The U of T Movie Database is a students built movie database. Every
          piece of data has been added by our amazing students dating back to
          2023. Our strong international focus and breadth of data is largely
          unmatched and something we're incredibly proud of. Put simply, we live
          and breathe community and that's precisely what makes us different.
